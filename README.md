## Overview

This repository contains **three projects** developed for the **Graphical and Interactive Systems (SGI) course, MEIC 2024/25** at the Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto.  

The projects focus on **3D graphics, scene representation, and interactive applications**, ranging from web-based graphics to a small 3D game.

## Projects

### Project 1 – 3D Graphics with Three.js
- **Goal:** Develop web-based 3D applications using **Three.js and JavaScript**.  
- **Focus:** Study, analysis, and implementation of computer graphics concepts. Add objects, materials, and interaction features to create a final 3D scene.  
- [→ See Project 1 README](tp1/README.md)

### Project 2 – Small 3D Graphics Engine
- **Goal:** Build a small 3D graphics engine that renders scenes described by a **YASF (Yet Another Scene Format)** JSON file.  
- **Focus:** Scene graph implementation, GUI controls for light sources and cameras, polygonal fill/wireframe switching.  
- [→ See Project 2 README](tp2/README.md)

### Project 3 – 3D Balloon Game
- **Goal:** Develop a small 3D game where the player controls a hot air balloon, navigating through a scene with other autonomous flying objects.  
- **Focus:** Use YASF partially, allow importing 3D models (OBJ, GLTF), implement game logic and interactive controls.  
- [→ See Project 3 README](tp3/README.md)
